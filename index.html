						<td><a href="work1.html">123 Studios! Brochure </a> </td>
						<td> I chose this artifact as one of my 7 pieces of work to display as I believe that this artifact displays the skills and business knowledge I have gained through this course. This assignment was to create a brochure informing the workers of the 123 studios! Company of the workplace environment policy. I belive this artifact best showcases my skills as it is designed very well and is written in a proper formal way. This was also one of my favorite assignments introduced throughout the course.

						<td><a href="work2.html">Excel Test  </a> </td>
						<td> I chose this artifact to be displayed in my E-Portfolio because learning how to navigate and use excel was one of the biggest challenges I faced in this course. This excel test artifact shows how I have applied hard work, practice, and teachers feedback into creating the best excel spreadsheet by correctly inputting and formatting my data and using the correct formulas.

						<td><a href="https://354227909.wixsite.com/my-site-5" target="_blank">123 Studios! Website </a> </td>
						<td> I chose the 123 Studios website to be displayed as I believe this is the best assignment I have created in this course. I worked very hard on this assignment and am very proud of it. I followed proper criteria and displayed exceptional presentation and informational writing skills. I was also not familiar with the tool (wix - website maker) I used to create this website so, I had to overcome several obstacles and learn how to navigate the new tool. In the end, I am very pleased with how the website turned out and proud to put display in on my E - Portfolio.
